# Cache layer

By default, Limestone API fetches data from the Limestone cache layer. It works way faster than fetching directly from Arweave Blockchain. Even so, thanks to signature verification prices data is still trusted and secure.

### Fetching prices from Arweave Blockchain

We strongly recommend using the default fetching mechanism. But if you want to fetch data directly from Arweave you can do it by initialising a new `LimestoneApi` client and setting `useCache` option to `false`.

```javascript
const limestoneArweaveClient = new limestone.LimestoneApi({
  useCache: false,
});

const price = await limestoneArweaveClient.getPrice("AR");

console.log(price.value); // AR price value fetched directly from Arweave
```
