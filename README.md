# What is Limestone API

Limestone API is a Javascript library for fetching trusted token pricing data from the [Limestone data ecosystem](https://github.com/limestone-finance/limestone/blob/master/README.md).

It is implemented as a Javascript wrapper for the [Limestone HTTP Api](docs/HTTP_API.md).

### ✅ Why Limestone API

#### ✓ Secure

Limestone pricing data is secured on the [Arweave](https://www.arweave.org/) chain and protected by the provider's collateral. [Learn more](https://github.com/limestone-finance/limestone/blob/master/README.md)

#### ✓ Easy to use

You don't need any API keys. Just install the npm package and add a single line of code.

#### ✓ 100+ tokens

We support BTC, ETH, AR, EUR, and many other crypto and fiat currencies. [All supported tokens](https://github.com/limestone-finance/limestone-api/blob/main/docs/ALL_SUPPORTED_TOKENS.md)

#### ✓ TypeScript Support
